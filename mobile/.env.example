# ============================================
# QUICK REFERENCE CHECKLIST
# ============================================
# □ Created Firebase project at console.firebase.google.com
# □ Enabled Authentication → Google Sign-In provider
# □ Created iOS/Android/Web app in Firebase project
# □ Downloaded GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS) or google-services.json (Android)
# □ Obtained all Firebase config values from project settings
# □ Found Web Client ID from Firebase Auth or Google Cloud Console
# □ Added both partner email addresses (already done ✓)
# □ Created Expo account at expo.dev (if needed)
# □ Ran 'eas init' to create Expo project (if needed)
# □ Copied project ID from Expo dashboard or CLI
# □ Renamed this file from .env.example to .env
# □ Added .env to .gitignore (already done ✓)
# ============================================

# ============================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ============================================
# Issue: "Missing EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID"
# Solution: Make sure you're using WEB Client ID, not iOS Client ID
#
# Issue: "Not authorized to access this app"
# Solution: Check that email addresses in env match Google sign-in accounts exactly
#
# Issue: "Invalid ID token"
# Solution: You're probably using iOS Client ID instead of Web Client ID
#
# Issue: Push notifications not working
# Solution: Must use physical device, not simulator. Set EXPO_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID
#
# Issue: "Configuration error"
# Solution: Check all Firebase values are correct, restart Expo with --clear flag
# ============================================

# ============================================
# SECURITY NOTES
# ============================================
# ⚠️  NEVER commit the actual .env file to git
# ⚠️  The .env file should be in .gitignore (already added)
# ⚠️  Only share .env file securely with your wife (encrypted)
# ⚠️  Rotate API keys if accidentally exposed
# ⚠️  Firebase API keys are safe to use in mobile apps (restricted by bundle ID)
# ============================================
